# COVID-19 Growth Dashboard

Another dashboard to visualize and examine the spread of COVID-19 around the world.

Credit goes to [Johns Hopkins University](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/) for the initial dashboard and the source data. The JHU Dashboard can be found [here](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html)

Source data is found in [this repo](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). This is updated nightly, and further data sources can be found in the README at that link.

Thanks to Github for the hosting.
