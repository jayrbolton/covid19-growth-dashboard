general
- Add more data viz colors and try not to repeat

graph
- fix the date alignments (eg. us totals vs NYC)
- make the lines straight
- show gridlines as white
- update labels to include metrics name (eg. "US Totals - Deaths")

- ??? need to figure out design and implementation
  (maybe just skip mobile support for now)
