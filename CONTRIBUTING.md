# Contributing to this COVID-19 dashboard
Hello, and thanks for your interest! This is an early project, but we welcome people who are interested in contributing.

## Setting Up a Development Environment
1. Install Node.js and the npm command line interface if you haven't already. You can find OS-specific instructions [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

2. Fork the COVID-19 dashboard repo and run `npm install`. The dashboard is a single page app written in Typescript with the following libaries:
* [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) for bundling and deployment
* [Preact](https://preactjs.com/), a ReactJS alternative, for layout and component management
* [Chartist](https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/) for some data layouts
* [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/) as a lightweight styling library

3. Enable your dev environment with by running `npm run dev`. This should build and start a local development server on port 1234. You can point your browser at http://localhost:1234 to see it in action. Any changes should automatically trigger a rebuild and refresh.
